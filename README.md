# AS4590 Codelists
OWL ontology registers - lists - of types of items required by the AS4590 standard.

Codelists or lists of terms required by data models are often delivered as human-readable tables, XML files or even SKOS vocabulary collections. This set of codelists are slightly more powerful: they are registers of types items - items with a specific class indicated. The types are as per the AS4590 requirements, FlatType, GeocodeType etc. but the objects are also fundamentally OWL class objects meaning they can be described with quite a range of OWL properties, includeing simple vocabulary properties used by SKOS. This allows these code list items to be used in SPARQL querying and for validation with more rigour and specificity than pure concept lists objects can.


## Purpose
The terms in these code lists will be used with the AS4590 ontology which is being created to describe the data within the Geocoded NAtional Address File, GNAF.
